The project deals with the development of utility software for the management of a library. In particular, it will be used to allow a simple and quick use of the list of books in the library, to be able to enroll people in the library and to take into account the loans made. The management also allows you to modify, search and delete the elements present in the system.
The system will automatically check the loans and highlight those overdue to facilitate the assignment of any sanctions by the librarian. External systems will be used to:
• authentication of those who can use the new system, ie librarians;
• the generation of fines for overdue loans.
The system will also carry out statistical analyzes, represented by graphs and rankings, of the subjects and objects that are part of the system for information research purposes.
